The == operator compares objects by identity.
 But sometimes youâ€™d rather compare the
 values of their actual properties. Write a
 function objEquals that takes two objects
 and returns true only if they have the same
  properties and property values. The
  Object.keys function might be useful!
  Test your function thoroughly.

Write a method flatten() can take an
array of arrays and return a single
array that has all the elements of the
original arrays. You should utilize the
reduce() method and the concat() method.
